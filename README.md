## About driver installation
Most of the Arduino boards you get from China do not have the original USB2Serial chip which is FTDI. Instead they have the CH340 on board. Whie FTDI's driver comes with standard OS, the one for CH340 need to be installed.

Following link brings you to a nice page with more infos about it and the direct link to the vendo's page of CH340 where you can download the CH340 drivers for all common OS.
